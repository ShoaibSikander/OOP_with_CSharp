# OOP_with_CSharp

This repository contains simple examples to understand the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) implemented in C#. During an online course named “C# Intermediate: Classes, Interface and OOP” offered by “Udemy”, instructor “Mosh Hamedani” explained the core concepts really briefly and then assigned some exercise tasks. Completing the assigned tasks gave me hands on experience of working with OOP in C#, which strengthened my knowledge further.

The course has been divided into several sections as it can be seen in the repository. Each section is about a particular concept of OOP in which lectures summary and exercise problems are provided by the instructor. After solving the assignment tasks, I have provided the codes separately in respective folders.
